I build efficient systems for large language models and agentic workflows. I am passionate about democratizing access to AI, open-source, and making the most out of our hardware resources.

Affiliations: 
- Senior Systems Researcher at Together.AI (GPU Kernels)
- PhD student at UC San Diego (on-leave)
- T5 contributor to [FlexFlow-Train](https://github.com/flexflow/flexflow-train)

Outside of work, I love playing piano and guitar, watching the Padres, and playing football.
